# Quantum IO

Quantum IO is a gaming environment designed to combat piracy by providing developers with various methods to protect their games, while giving gamers a console-like experience, for every single one of their games. 

Our goal is to instantly turn any PC into a gaming console, without doing changes to the Operating System. 

Quantum IO plans on supporting any gaming controllers as well as a handful of devices.
